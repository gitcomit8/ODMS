# Autocomplete Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a Gmail-style lookahead autosuggest feature for the registration number field in the event request form.

## Issue Fixed
The dropdown was initially not visible due to `overflow: hidden` CSS property on table elements in the global stylesheet. This has been resolved with specific CSS overrides.

## Files Modified

### 1. Backend API Controller
**File:** `src/main/java/in/srmup/odms/controller/api/StudentApiController.java`

**Changes:**
- Added new endpoint: `GET /api/students/search?query={text}`
- Returns top 10 matching students based on registration number prefix
- Added `StudentSuggestion` inner class for JSON response
- Case-insensitive search with `startsWith` matching

**Example Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "regNo": "RA2111003010001",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "branch": "CSE",
    "year": 2024
  }
]
```

### 2. Test Data Loader (Development Only)
**File:** `src/main/java/in/srmup/odms/config/TestDataLoader.java`

**Purpose:** Automatically loads test student data on application startup in dev profile
- Loads 10 sample students with various registration number patterns
- Only runs if student table is empty
- Only active in dev profile

### 3. Frontend Template
**File:** `src/main/resources/templates/event-request-form.html`

**Changes:**

#### CSS Additions:
- Fixed table overflow issues with `overflow: visible !important` on table, tbody, tr, and td elements
- `.autocomplete-wrapper` - Container for input and dropdown with proper positioning
- `.autocomplete-items` - Styled dropdown with high z-index (9999), shadow, and border
- `.autocomplete-active` - Highlight for keyboard navigation
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Added `display: block !important` to ensure dropdown items are visible
- Added `margin-top: 1px` for better visual separation

#### JavaScript Functions:
1. `handleAutocomplete(input)` - Main handler with 300ms debounce
2. `fetchSuggestions(input, query)` - Calls API and builds dropdown with console logging
3. `selectStudent(input, student)` - Fills all fields when student selected
4. `handleFocus(input)` - Shows dropdown on focus if value exists
5. `handleBlur(input)` - Closes dropdown and validates
6. `closeAllLists()` - Cleanup function
7. Keyboard navigation support (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
8. Added debugging console.log statements

#### HTML Changes:
- Wrapped registration number inputs in `.autocomplete-wrapper` div
- Changed `onblur` to use new autocomplete handlers
- Added `oninput` and `onfocus` event handlers
- Updated `addRow()` function to include autocomplete wrapper

4. A dropdown will appear with matching students
5. Use mouse or arrow keys to select
6. Press Enter or click to auto-fill all student details

## Testing

### API Testing (Confirmed Working âœ…)
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/students/search?query=RA"
# Returns 7 students with registration numbers starting with "RA"

curl "http://localhost:8080/api/students/search?query=CS"  
# Returns 2 students with registration numbers starting with "CS"
```

### Browser Testing
1. Ensure application is running
2. Navigate to `/dev-login`
3. Login with `faculty@university.edu`
4. Go to Event Request Form
5. Type "RA" in Registration Number field
6. Verify dropdown appears with 7 suggestions
7. Click or use keyboard to select a student
8. Verify all fields auto-fill correctly

### Test Data Available
- 7 students with "RA" prefix
- 2 students with "CS" prefix  
- 1 student with "EC" prefix
- Total: 10 test students loaded automatically in dev mode

## Troubleshooting

### If dropdown is not visible:
1. Open browser developer console (F12)
2. Type in registration field - you should see console logs:
   - "Suggestions received: X [array]"
   - "Dropdown created with X items"
3. Check Elements tab - verify `.autocomplete-items` div exists
4. Check CSS - ensure `overflow: visible` on table elements
5. Verify z-index of dropdown is 9999

### If no suggestions appear:
1. Check console for API errors
2. Verify students exist in database
3. Check network tab for API call to `/api/students/search`
4. Verify CSRF token is included in request

## API Endpoint

**URL:** `/api/students/search`  
**Method:** `GET`  
**Parameters:** `query` (string) - Search prefix  
**Authentication:** Required (CSRF token)  
**Returns:** JSON array of StudentSuggestion objects  
**Limit:** 10 results maximum

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6 support
- Tested with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## CSS Override Details
To fix the visibility issue, the following CSS overrides were added:
```css
#participantTable { overflow: visible !important; }
#participantTable tbody { overflow: visible !important; }
#participantTable tr { overflow: visible !important; }
#participantTable td { overflow: visible !important; position: relative; }
.autocomplete-items { z-index: 9999 !important; }
.autocomplete-items div { display: block !important; }
```

## Notes
- Suggestions are limited to 10 to maintain performance
- Search is case-insensitive
- Only matches registration numbers starting with the query
- Test data is automatically loaded in dev profile
- Dropdown has high z-index to appear above all elements
- Console logging enabled for debugging
