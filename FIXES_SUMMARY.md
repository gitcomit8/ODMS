# ODMS Application - Issues Fixed

## 🎯 Summary
Successfully resolved all 500 Internal Server Errors in the ODMS application. Both the Admin Dashboard and Event Request Form are now fully functional.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Dashboard (HTTP 500 → HTTP 200) ✅

**Problem:** 
- Admin dashboard at `/admin/dashboard` was returning 500 Internal Server Error
- CSRF token issues in the template

**Root Cause:**
- Template was trying to include CSRF tokens but security was configured to disable CSRF
- Mismatch between security configuration and template expectations

**Solution:**
```html
<!-- REMOVED: CSRF token from admin-dashboard.html -->
<input th:name="${_csrf.parameterName}" th:value="${_csrf.token}" type="hidden"/>

<!-- FIXED: Clean form without CSRF -->
<form method="post" th:action="@{/admin/update-role}">
    <input name="userId" th:value="${user.id}" type="hidden"/>
    <select name="role">...</select>
    <button type="submit">Update</button>
</form>
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/main/resources/templates/admin-dashboard.html`
- `/src/main/java/in/srmup/odms/controller/AdminController.java` (added error handling)

### 2. Event Request Form (HTTP 500 → HTTP 200) ✅

**Problem:**
- Event request form at `/event-requests/new` was returning 500 Internal Server Error
- Field mapping issues between Thymeleaf template and Java model

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect field name mappings in the Thymeleaf template
- Template was using `registrationNumber` but model expected `regNo`
- Template was using `academicYear` but model expected `academicYr`

**Solution:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE (incorrect field names) -->
th:field="*{participants[__${itemStat.index}__].registrationNumber}"
th:field="*{participants[__${itemStat.index}__].academicYear}"

<!-- AFTER (correct field names) -->
th:field="*{participants[__${itemStat.index}__].regNo}"
th:field="*{participants[__${itemStat.index}__].academicYr}"
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/main/resources/templates/event-request-form.html`
- `/src/main/java/in/srmup/odms/controller/EventRequestController.java` (added error handling)

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling ✅

**Added:**
- Try-catch blocks in controllers for better error detection
- Custom error page template for debugging
- Proper error logging with stack traces

**New Files Created:**
- `/src/main/resources/templates/error-page.html`
